## MAJOR FINDINGS
1. California, New York, Texas, and Washington were the top 4 highest revenue-generating states in the US.
2. The top 4 subcategories of items being purchased range from Phones, chairs, binders, and storage. This suggests that work-from-home jobs might be on the increase.
3. In the customer segment, the Consumer segment had the highest number of orders. Corporate customers contributed more to average revenue per transaction.
4. People mostly preferred Cash on delivery (COD) compared to online payments and the use of cards. The reason might be to be sure that what they ordered is what they receive.
5. People used standard class as the shipping mode because it is relatively cheap and also delivers within 4-7 days of the order.

## MY RECOMMENDATIONS

These are my recommendations:
1.  Speed up shipping timelines, especially for high-value customers using Standard Class
2.  Offer better discounts to Corporate buyers in low-performing states to boost volume
3.  Shift focus to high-margin subcategories like Chairs and Technology accessories
4.  Monitor regional KPIs monthly using a centralized dashboard
5.  Target the Online and Corporate segments in marketing campaigns
